# Password_Generator

Created the JavaScript file for a program that generates a random password based on user criteria

User chooses a character value between 8 and 128, then selects whether or not they need uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters as requirements for their password. As long as the user selects at least one of those options, they will be able to generate a password by clicking the generate password button.
